What is Liffery?
Liffery is a quiet online space where people come to store and collect items they find online or offline. We enable our users to research the perfect product, collect gift ideas or get inspiration from a close group of connections. Our space is very versatile though, so how you end up using it is entirely up to you…

Add ITEMS
Adding items is the core of Liffery: Let’s say you’re browsing the web and see a product you like, but don’t want to buy straight away. Simply by using the website-link this product can be added to your Liffery account. So when the time is right you can come back and browse through your own collection of items.

Organise in CHANNELS
From furnishing your new apartment to your little sister’s birthday: There are many occasions that require careful consideration of different products. By organising your items in different channels you cannot only keep things tidy, but with different privacy settings also control who can see what.

Connect with PEOPLE
You know someone with the best taste in clothes? You trust your friends’ opinion on products way more than any online review? Connect with them on Liffery so you can inspire each other’s choice and always know exactly what gifts to give each other…
